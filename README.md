# Introduction

This paper proposes a novel automated graph neural network search framework (Auto-HeG) for heterophilic graphs. 
Specifically, this work incorporates heterophily into three stages:
(1) heterophilic GNN search space design;
(2) progressive supernet training based on layer-wise heterophily variation;
(3) heterophily-aware distance guided architecture selection.

Following is the main framework of the proposed Auto-HeG:
